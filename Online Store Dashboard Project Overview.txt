ðŸš€ Project Success: Online Retail Store DashboardðŸš€

I recently completed a project that involved creating a comprehensive dashboard to address critical questions posed by our CEO and CMO. Using Power BI and Tableau, I transformed raw data into actionable insights to aid in strategic decision-making. Hereâ€™s a glimpse into the project:

ðŸ›  Project Objective:
To create visuals that address the key questions from the CEO and CMO of an online retail store, enabling them to make informed decisions for the business.

ðŸ“Š Data Cleanup:
Before diving into the analysis, I performed extensive data cleanup:
- Ensured that the quantity sold was not below 1 unit.
- Checked that the unit price was not below $0.
Using conditional formulas and data transformation methods, I excluded erroneous data to ensure accuracy in our visuals.

ðŸŽ¨ Visuals Created:

1. Monthly Revenue Time Series (2011):
   - Visualized the monthly revenue trends for 2011 to help the CEO identify seasonal patterns and forecast for the next year.

2. Top 10 Countries by Revenue:
   - Created a bar chart excluding the United Kingdom to show the top 10 revenue-generating countries along with quantities sold, helping the CMO identify key markets.

3. Top 10 Customers by Revenue:
   - Designed a descending bar chart to highlight the top revenue-generating customers, enabling targeted customer satisfaction strategies.

4. Global Demand Analysis:
   - Mapped out the demand for products across all countries (excluding the UK) to assist the CEO in identifying regions for potential expansion.

ðŸ’¼ Tools Used:
- Power BI
-Excel For Quick Analysis
-PowerPoint For Presentation

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights:
- Achieved a total revenue of $9.84M in 2011 with significant year-over-year growth.
- Identified Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France, and Australia as top revenue-generating countries outside the UK.
- Highlighted the top customer, generating $271.61K in revenue.

âœ¨ Results:
The dashboard has provided the CEO and CMO with clear, data-driven insights, facilitating better strategic planning and customer targeting. This project underscores the power of data visualization in driving business growth.
